# Amazon_Reviews_Analysis
Analysis of large Amazon Review data set using AWS and SQL

## Overview
In this analysis we were tasked with analyzing reviews that are part of the Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program allows manufacturers to receive reviews for their product by providing their products to Vine members. These manufacturers pay Amazon a small fee to be a part of this program. We are looking to determine whether or not there is any bias among these paid reviews and how that may impact the popularity and success for those manufacturers. We sampled the Amazon Video Game reviews for this data exploration. 

## Results

### Vine Reviews vs. Non-Vine Reviews Quantity
* There were 94 Vine Paid Reviews and 40471 Non-Vine Unpaid Reviews. 

### Vine Reviews vs. Non-Vine Reviews Percentage of 5-Star Reviews Quantity
* There were 48 Vine 5-Star Reviews and 15663 Non-Vine 5-Star Reviews

### Vine Reviews vs. Non-Vine Reviews Percentage of 5-Star Reviews Percentage
* Approximately 51% of Vine Reviews we 5-Star and 39% of Non-Vine Reviews were 5-Star

## Summary
It does appear that there is a slight bias towards Vine customers giving their respective products 5-star reviews. This is especially salient due to the small sample size compared to the Amazon unpaid reviews. The Vine reviews make up a very small percentage of the reviews (98 Vine vs 40,471 Non-
Vine).
